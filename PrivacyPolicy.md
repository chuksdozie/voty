# Voty App

<p>
Welcome to the Voty app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Dev Chuks. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it except the initial registration on the web platform which is solely used for Voting ID generation and to prevent duplicate registrations.

Howbeit, no sensitive information is required through out the entire app
